Ideas related to this notion of hierarchy have been discussed by Jones (1976), but her view of temporal units is tied to the notion of perceptual rhythms that result from oscillators in the auditory system becoming entrained to periodicities of different length in the signal. In the view that I am presenting here, the notion of a unit does not rely on the existence of periodicities. Steiger and Bregman (1981). Shepard (1981). The evidence involves the time taken to imagine visual transformations of different sizes, (cooper and Shepard, 1973a, 1973b; Shepard and Metzler, 1971) or the time required to shift one's attention across different distances in two- dimensional space (Tsal, 1983; Shulman, Remington and McLean, 1979) and in three-dimensional space (Downing and Pinker, 1985). Evidence for analog tactile representation comes from experìments by carpenter and Eisenberg (1978) and Marmor and Zaback (1976). Rhodes (1985). This has been found in birds (Knudsen 1982, 1984) and mammals (Drager and Hubel, 1975, Palmer and King, 1982) I am indebted to Michael cohen for finding this interpretation of the experi- ment. Examples of signal-processing approaches to the separation of signals by their spatial location include Mitchell, Ross, and Yates (1971) and Strube (1981). There have been two attempts that I know of to use other sorts of cues, by Parsons (1976) and Weintraub (1984). A number of approaches to the separation of speech from interfering noise are described in Lim (1983). Norman (1966). van Noorden (1975) p. 22. Deutsch (1975). Judd (1977). Deutsch (1979).

See Moore (1982), Ch. 4, for a review of pitch phenomena. van Noorden (1975). Bregman, Pinker (1978). A result of spectral position on segregation of tones in the absence of a differ- ence between them in (missing) fundamental frequency was also found by Kin- ney (1961). The segregation affected the listener's ability to judge the duration of a gap between the tones. Bregman and Levitan (1983). See also Singh (1987). Bregman and Liao (1984).

Warren, Obusek, Farmer and Warren (1969). See also the review of the research relating to this phenomenon in Warren (1982), Ch. 5. McNally and Handel (1977). The matching in frequency was studied by Bregman and Pinker (1978) and the density of the simultaneous components by Vicario (1982). Steiger (1980). Wessel (1979). The role of the higher harmonics in increasing the brightness of a tone was described by Helmholtz (1859), P. 62. Risset and Wessel (1982) caution that the estimate of brightness would also have to take into account the masking of one partial by another, and the fact that the loudness of any group of harmonics depends upon whether its components are in the same critical band or in different ones.

The notion of pitch movement detectors has been supported by evidence from psychophysical observations (Regan and Tansley, 1979). Kay and Matth- ews (1972), Green and Kay (1973), and Gardner and Wilson (1979) have found that the auditory system can be habituated to particular kinds of frequency This is a portion of the eBook at doi:10.7551/mitpress/1486.001.0001 Downloaded from http://direct.mit.edu/books/monograph/chapter-pdf/2444588/9780262269209_cai.pdf by UNIV OF MELBOURNE user on 08 December 2025

Pollack (1968) has also found psychophysical evidence for channels in the auditory system sensitive to particular directions of frequency change. Physiological measurement on bats (Suga 1965a, 1965b) shows FM-sensitive auditory neurons. Other physiological observations have been reported by Evans and Whitfield (1964) and Vartanian (1974).

Notes to pages 133-149711 chapter 3). It took a little while for the sense of two distinct streams to build up despite the fact that the listener was not trying to follow a sequence that was alternating between frequency ranges. Bregman and Dannenbring (1973). A related experiment was performed for a "ramped" condition by Anstis and Saida (1985). Despite using a different methodology and a different type of ramp (sinusoidal), they obtained similar results. Heise and Miller (1951). Jones (1976). Bregman and Campbell (1971).

See also Thomas and Fitzgibbons (1971) who reported that successive tones within recycled sequences of four items all have to be within half an octave for accurate identification of order at the limiting value of 125 msec per item.

This term was used by Neisser (1967). It has also been called "precategorical acoustic store" by Crowder and Morton (1969). See also Darwin, Turvey, and Crowder (1972). Divenyi and Hirsh (1978). For example, Bregman (1978b) and Handel, Weaver, and Lawson (1983). For example, Neisser and Hirst (1974) and Barsz (1988). Warren and Ackroff (1976) employed this method.
