Chapter 3 Integration of Simultaneous Auditory Components The task of segregating sounds that had arisen from different sources was described in chapter 1 through the example of the spectrogram of a mixture of sounds (see figure 1.4). It was apparent that there are two kinds of grouping to be done. First, a process of sequential grouping was needed to put some of the spectral components that followed one another in time into the same perceptual stream, where they could be used to calculate the sequential properties of a source of sound in the environment (such as its melody or rhythm). This process was the subject of chapter 2. A second process was needed to partition the set of concurrent components into distinct subsets, and to place them into different streams where they could be used to calculate the spectral properties of distinct sources of sound (such as timbre or pitch). It is this process that will be the subject of the present chapter. The question of how to study the process of simultaneous group- ing and segregation is not obvious. However, in the summer of 197S, Alex Rudnicky and I began work on a set of auditory demonstrations that were related to the question of whether two tones could be over- lapped in time and still separate into two perceptual components, as opposed to becoming a simple complex tone. The first demonstration made use of a repeating cycle of two discrete tones, A and B, each of the same fixed duration and a fixed rate of repetition. The two tones were at different frequencies, but overlapped in time as shown in figure 3.1. The percentage of the length of the tone that overlapped the other tone was varied. We found that if we used tones whose duration was, for example, 250 msec per tone, and that were only 25 percent or 50 percent overlapped (i.e., relatively asynchronous in onset) the tones would segregate clearly into separate streams. When the temporal overlap reached 88 percent (almost synchronous onsets) the tones fused into one percept. When the two tones fused the resul- tant tone sounded complex, but when they segregated each sounded pure. Segregation was clearer when the frequency separation was This is a portion of the eBook at doi:10.7551/mitpress/1486.001.0001 Downloaded from http://direct.mit.edu/books/monograph/chapter-pdf/2444582/9780262269209_cac.pdf by UNIV OF MELBOURNE user on 08 December 2025

This demonstration used tones with silences between them. We decided to see whether two simultaneous and continuous tones of different frequencies could be induced to segregate or fuse depending on brief amplitude changes that were synchronous or asynchronous for the two frequencies. We introduced brief amplitude drops (8 per second) in the two, otherwise continuous, tones, causing a warbling sound in each tone. This is illustrated in figure 3.2, with the two dashed lines representing the tones and the V's representing the dips in loudness. (In the example the dips are not synchronous.) We could not cause the tones to totally segregate on the basis of asynchronous warbling. When the warbles were at different rates for the two fre- quencies, the two different rates could be heard, but the tones were not really perceptually segregated; the quality of each one was affected by the presence of the other. So far, we had seen that when each component switched complete- ly on and off, with a sizable off period, stream separation was high under asynchronous conditions; however, where the amplitude merely dropped off briefly, asynchrony did not produce complete separation. We then decided to confine our attention to an intermedi- ate condition, which used 224-msec tones with 32-msec silences be- tween repetitions. When the tones had asynchronous onsets in this condition, we were able to perceptually pick out the top or bottom stream. An analogy to our earlier studies of stream segregation was noted: The relatively pure-sounding tones of the streams emerged only after several cycles, a period of time that apparently was required for the buildup of the stream criteria. We next made a series of observations employing two tones, a high and a low, repeating at different rates, e.g., 5 tones per second for the high tone and 4 tones per second for the low tone. Thus, once per second the high and low tones would have synchronous onsets; otherwise they were out of synchrony. The perceptual experience consisted of two streams, but with some interesting effects. Every time the onset synchrony occurred, a rich tone was heard in the lower This is a portion of the eBook at doi:10.7551/mitpress/1486.001.0001 Downloaded from http://direct.mit.edu/books/monograph/chapter-pdf/2444582/9780262269209_cac.pdf by UNIV OF MELBOURNE user on 08 December 2025

The lower tone was heard to be louder as well. The lower tone percept thus seemed to capture the energy of the synchronous higher tone. This reminded us of the exclusive allocation principle in perception which states that a piece of perceptual evidence has to be allocated to one perceptual entity or another, but not to more than one at a time. Here a certain amount of the energy was being sub- tracted from the upper tone and added to the lower one. We then went on to listen to cycles that contained repetitions of three tones of different frequencies that might or might not overlap in time. In this example, it was possible to hear three streams. Asyn- chronous onsets of three tones did produce segregation, but not as strongly as with only two tones. Nonetheless we made an interesting observation. One of the patterns in this series included a temporal point at which a tone in all three streams had a simultaneous onset. At this point a strong "vertical" fusion took place. This fusion was differ- ent from the one we had encountered in the two-stream situation in that now the fusion was so compelling that it rendered the new fused unit quite perceptually independent of the single-tone streams, and did not simply color the timbre of the tone in the lowest stream. We should note that since only about one-eighth of each stream was composed of silence, most of the time all three frequencies were present simultaneously. Hence all combination tones, beat phe- nomena, dissonance, and so on, were occurring most of the time. Yet when the streams segregated they sounded pure, all those acoustic combination effects being ignored by the ear. Apparently when the contributing tones were assigned to separate perceptual objects (streams) the awareness of these interactions was suppressed. We might ask, if this is the case, why the ear ever hears these interaction phenomena if it is capable of rejecting them. The answer may depend upon the fact that in some cases, such as when the combination effects are caused by the interaction of acoustic components that all belong to the same real-world sound, these phenomena are as characteristic of that source of sound as the pure-tone components are and therefore should be incorporated into the description.

216Chapter 3 But how can our auditory systems tell the difference between acoustic phenomena that are an intrinsic part of a sound and those that arise from the accidental co-occurrence of two unrelated sounds? It must obviously fall back on some of the same techniques that it uses to decide whether pure-tone components belong to the same sound. These cues may act to bind the interaction effects into one or another stream. Take, for example, a case in which two complex tones, each composed of a simple harmonic series and therefore heard as having no internal dissonance, are sounded at the same moment. In this case the combination phenomena have a synchronous onset with the pure-tone components, and therefore are also captured into the stream, adding to its timbre or perceptual complexity. On the other hand, if one of these tones occurs for a short time by itself and then is joined by a second tone, the interaction properties will not appear until the second tone is sounded and therefore the onset of the interac- tion phenomena starts in synchrony with the second tone but not the first. Under these circumstances, the richness or dissonance would be expected to be assigned to the second tone but not the first. However, if the second tone lasted longer than the first, so that it appeared at the end without any interaction components, the auditory system would have evidence that it, too, was pure and might not assign the inter- action properties to it either. The most important observations of Rudnicky and myself could be summarized by saying that the onset synchrony of elements in two streams increased the perceived intensity of the element in the lower stream and decreased the intensity of the one in the upper stream, and that this effect decreased with an increase of frequency separation between the two simultaneous tones. Although the experimenters were trained listeners and could de- scribe the phenomena reliably to one another, the requirement of re- plicating the observations with naive subjects required us to reduce the task to one involving simple comparisons or descriptions. For this reason, the experiment by Bregman and Pinker was undertaken.284 A Miniature Scene-Analysis Problem This experiment has already been described in chapter 1 and illus- trated in figure 1.16. It involved the sequential capturing of one com- ponent from within a two-component tone. It used a cycle in which a pure tone A was followed by a pair of more-or-less simultaneous pure tones B and C. The latter pair could be viewed as forming a complex tone BC. The timing was as follows: 117 msec of silence, A for 117 msec, 47 msec of silence, and then BC, with each of tones B This is a portion of the eBook at doi:10.7551/mitpress/1486.001.0001 Downloaded from http://direct.mit.edu/books/monograph/chapter-pdf/2444582/9780262269209_cac.pdf by UNIV OF MELBOURNE user on 08 December 2025 

Integration of Simultaneous Components217 and C lasting for 117 msec. This pattern was repeated cyclically. In figure 1.16, tone A is just a little higher in frequency than B and tone C comes on a bit earlier than B; however, not all the conditions were like this. The cycle could be heard in more than one way depending on the frequencies and timing of the three-pure tone components. One way was as an alternation of a pure tone A and a rich tone BC, the repeti- tions of each of these belonging to a stream of its own. Another way was to hear the pure tones A and B in one stream (AB AB AB.. and the isolated pure tone C in another (C C C...). There were, of course, some ambiguous cases in which the listener experienced some mixture of these two percepts. The way the listener heard the sounds depended on two factors that were manipulated in the experiment: (1) the frequency separation between tones A and B, tone A varying in frequency from a semitone above B to 1.7 octaves above, and (2) the asynchrony of onset of B and C, tone C either coming on synchro- nously with B or else leading it or lagging it by 29 or 58 msec (25 or 50 percent of the length of one tone). In one experiment the listeners were asked to judge the richness of the timbre of tone C. "Timbre" was defined for them as "the quality that distinguishes, for example, the sounds of different musical in- struments producing notes of the same pitch." They were asked to judge this richness in relation to two standard tones that were pre- sented before each judgment was made. The "pure" standard tone contained only tone C, but
