Chapter 1 The Auditory Scene Historical Difference between Auditory and Visual Perception If you were to pick up a general textbook on perception written before 1965 and leaf through it, you would not find any great concern with the perceptual or ecological questions about audition. By a per- ceptual question I mean one that asks how our auditory systems could build a picture of the world around us through their sensitivity to sound, whereas by an ecological one I am referring to one that asks how our environment tends to create and shape the sound around us. (The two kinds of questions are related. Only by being aware of how the sound is created and shaped in the world can we know how to use it to derive the properties of the sound-producing events around us.) Instead, you would find discussions of such basic auditory qualities as loudness and pitch. For each of these, the textbook might discuss the psychophysical question: which physical property of the sound gives rise to the perceptual quality that we experience? It might also consider the question of how the physiology of the ear and nervous system could respond to those properties of sound. The most percep- tual of the topics that you might encounter would be concerned with how the sense of hearing can tell the listener where sounds are com- ing from. Under this heading, some consideration would be given to the role of audition in telling us about the world around us. For the most part, instead of arising from everyday life, the motivation of much of the research on audition seems to have its origins in the medical study of deafness, where the major concerns are the sensitiv- ity of the auditory system to weak sounds, the growth in perceived intensity with increases in the energy of the signal, and the effects of exposure to noise. The situation would be quite different in the treatment of vision. It is true that you would see a treatment of psychophysics and physiol- ogy, and indeed there would be some consideration of such deficits as colorblindness, but this would not be the whole story. You would also find discussions of higher-level principles of organization, such This is a portion of the eBook at doi:10.7551/mitpress/1486.001.0001 Downloaded from http://direct.mit.edu/books/monograph/chapter-pdf/2444580/9780262269209_caa.pdf by UNIV OF MELBOURNE user on 08 December 2025 

2Chapter 1 as those responsible for the constancies. There would, for example, be a description of size constancy, the fact that we tend to see the size of an object as unchanged when it is at a different distance, despite the fact that the image that it projects on our retinas shrinks as it moves further away. Apparently some complex analysis by the brain takes into account clues other than retinal size in arriving at the perceived size of an object. Why should there be such a difference? A proponent of the "great man" theory of history might argue that it was because the fathers of Gestalt psychology, who opened up the whole question of perceptual organization, had focused on vision and never quite got around to audition. However, it is more likely that there is a deeper reason. We came to know about the puzzles of visual perception through the arts of draw- ing and painting. The desire for accurate portrayal led to an under- standing of the cues for distance and certain facts about projective geometry. This was accompanied by the development of the physical analysis of projected images, and eventually the invention of the camera. Early on, the psychologist was faced with the discrepancy between what was on the photograph or canvas and what the person saw. The earlier development of sophisticated thinking in the field of visual perception may also have been due to the fact that it was much easier to create a visual display with exactly specified properties than it was to shape sound in equally exact ways. If so, the present-day development of the computer analysis and synthesis of sound ought to greatly accelerate the study of auditory perception. Of course there is another possibility that explains the slighting of audition in the textbook: Perhaps audition is really a much simpler sense and there are no important perceptual phenomena like the visual constancies to be discovered. This is a notion that can be rejected. We can show that such com- plex phenomena as constancies exist in hearing, too. One example is timbre constancy. A friend's voice has the same perceived timbre in a quiet room as at a cocktail party. Yet at the party, the set of frequency components arising from that voice is mixed at the listener's ear with frequency components from other sources. The total spectrum of energy that reaches the ear may be quite different in different environ- ments. To recognize the unique timbre of the voice we have to isolate the frequency components that are responsible for it from others that are present at the same time. A wrong choice of frequency compo- nents would change the perceived timbre of the voice. The fact that we can usually recognize the timbre implies that we regularly choose This is a portion of the eBook at doi:10.7551/mitpress/1486.001.0001 Downloaded from http://direct.mit.edu/books/monograph/chapter-pdf/2444580/9780262269209_caa.pdf by UNIV OF MELBOURNE user on 08 December 2025 

The Auditory Scene3 the right components in different contexts. Just as in the case of the visual constancies, timbre constancy will have to be explained in terms of a complicated analysis by the brain, and not merely in terms of a simple registration of the input by the brain. There are some practical reasons for trying to understand this con- stancy. There are engineers currently trying to design computers that can understand what a person is saying. However, in a noisy environ- ment the speaker's voice comes mixed with other sounds. To a naive computer, each different sound that the voice comes mixed with makes it sound as if different words were being spoken or as if they were spoken by a different person. The machine cannot correct for the particular listening conditions as a human can. If the study of human audition were able to lay bare the principles that govern the human skill, there is some hope that a computer could be designed to mimic it. The Problem of Scene Analysis Itis not entirely true that textbooks ignore complex perceptual phenomena in audition. However, they are often presented as an array of baffling illusions.' They seem more like disconnected frag- ments than a foundation for a theory of auditory perception. My pur- pose in this book is to try to see them as oblique glimpses of a general auditory process of organization that has evolved, in our auditory systems, to solve a problem that I will refer to as "auditory scene analysis." Let me clarify what I mean by auditory scene analysis. The best way to begin is to ask ourselves what perception is for. Since Aris- totle, many philosophers and psychologists have believed that per- ception is the process of using the information provided by our senses to form mental representations of the world around us. In using the word representations, we are implying the existence of a two-part system: one part forms the representations and another uses them to do such things as calculate appropriate plans and actions. The job of perception, then, is to take the sensory input and to derive a useful representation of reality from it. An important part of building a representation is to decide which parts of the sensory stimulation are telling us about the same environ- mental object or event. Unless we put the right combination of sen- sory evidence together, we will not be able to recognize what is going on. A simple example is shown in the top line of figure 1.1. The pattern of letters is meaningful, but the meaning cannot be extracted because the letters are actually a mixture from two sentences, and This is a portion of the eBook at doi:10.7551/mitpress/1486.001.0001 Downloaded from http://direct.mit.edu/books/monograph/chapter-pdf/2444580/9780262269209_caa.pdf by UNIV OF MELBOURNE user on 08 December 2025 

4Chapter 1 AICSAITT STIOTOS A1CSAITT S110T0S Figure 1.1 Top line: a string of letters that makes no sense because it is a mixture of two messages. Bottom line: the component messages are segregated by visual factors. (From Bregman 1981b.) the two cannot be separated. However, if,as in the lower line of the figure, we give the eyes some assistance, the meaning becomes apparent. This business of separating evidencé has been faced in the design of computer systems for recognizing the objects in natural scenes or in drawings. Figure 1.2 shows a line drawing of some blocks.2 We can imagine that the picture has been translated into a pattern in the mem- ory of the computer by some process that need not concern us. We might think that once it was entered, all that we would have to do to enable the computer to decide which objects were present in the scene would be to supply it with a description of the shape of each possible one. But the problem is not as easy as all that. Before the machine could make any decision, it would have to be able to tell which parts of the picture represented parts of the same object. To our human eyes it appears that the regions labeled A and B are parts of a single block. This is not immediately obvious to a computer. In simple line drawings there is a rule that states that any white area totally sur- rounded by lines must depict a single surface. This rule implies that in figure 1.2 the whole of region A is part of a single surface. The reason for grouping region A with B is much more complex. The question of how it can be done can be set aside for the moment. The point of the example is that unless regions A and B are indeed considered part of a single object, the description that the computer will be able to construct will not be correct and the elongated shape formed out of A, B, and other regions will not be seen. It seems as though a pre- liminary step along the road to recognition would be to program the computer to do the equivalent of taking a set of crayons and coloring in, with the same color, all those regions that were parts of the same block. Then some subsequent recognition process could simply try to form a description of a single shape from each set in which the regions were the same color. This allocation of regions to objects is what is known to researchers in machine vision as the scene analysis problem. There are similar problems in hearing. Take the case of a baby being spoken to by her mother. The baby starts to imitate her This is a portion of the eBook at doi:10.7551/mitpress/1486.001.0001 Downloaded from http://direct.mit.edu/books/monograph/chapter-pdf/2444580/9780262269209_caa.pdf by UNIV OF MELBOURNE user on 08 December 2025 

The Auditory Scene5 Figure 1.2 A line drawing of blocks for visual scene analysis. (After Guzman 1969.) mother's voice. However, she does not insert into the imitation the squeaks of her cradle that have been occurring at the same time. Why not? A physical record of what she has heard would include them. Somehow she has been able to reject the squeak as not being part of the perceptual "object" formed by her mother's voice. In doing so, the infant has solved a scene analysis problem in audition. It is important to emphasize again that the way that sensory inputs are grouped by our nervous systems determines the patterns that we perceive. In the case of the drawings of blocks, if areas E, F, and H were grouped as parts of the same object, we would see the L-shaped object shown at the right. The shape of the object formed by this grouping of areas is an emergent property, since it is not a property of
