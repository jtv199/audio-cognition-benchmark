## Key Themes Across Chapters

### **Mental Workload & Presentation Level**
- Chapters 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 emphasize the critical importance of reporting acoustic presentation levels
- Sensory-Cognitive Interaction Theory (SCIT) framework appears throughout

### **Attention Mechanisms**
- Chapters 4, 6 cover selective, divided, and sustained attention paradigms
- Direct relevance to Layer 2 (Cognitive Control) tasks in benchmark

### **Working Memory**
- Chapters 4, 5, 6 discuss auditory working memory tasks
- Listening span, n-back, PASAT directly applicable to benchmark design

### **Clinical Assessment**
- Chapter 6 provides detailed neuropsychological test protocols
- RAVLT, PASAT, Halstead-Reitan battery relevant for human baseline comparisons

## Usage Notes

All chapters have been extracted from the EPUB and converted to markdown format. The extracted text preserves:
- Heading structure (using markdown # syntax)
- Emphasis (using *italics* and **bold**)
- Paragraph breaks
- Basic list formatting

Note: Figures, tables, and complex formatting are marked but not fully rendered. References to figures appear as "Figure X.Y" in the text.
