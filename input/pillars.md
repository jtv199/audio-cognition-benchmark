Field & Taxonomy,Taxonomy Category,The Core Question the Brain is Solving,Concrete Example Scenario
1. Ecological Psychology(Physics of Events),Vibrating Solids,"""What is the material and mass of this object?""","Hearing a thud and knowing the package contains a heavy book, not a pillow."
,Liquids,"""How viscous is this fluid and is the container full?""",Listening to a coffee pot fill up and stopping before it overflows without looking.
,Aerodynamics,"""How much pressure/force is being released?""",Hearing a tire hiss and estimating if it is a slow leak or a blowout.
,Interaction Type,"""What happened to the object?""",Distinguishing between a glass bouncing (elastic return) vs. breaking (structural failure).
2. Comp. Scene Analysis(Grouping Algorithms),Primitive Grouping,"""Do these acoustic bits belong to the same source?""","Hearing a rapid sequence of high and low beeps and automatically perceiving them as two separate ""streams."""
,Schema-Based Grouping,"""Is the specific pattern I am looking for present here?""","Listening for your own name in a loud, crowded restaurant (The Cocktail Party Effect)."
3. Neuroscience(Anatomy/Dual Stream),Ventral Stream,"""What is the semantic identity of this sound?""","Hearing a bark and accessing the concept of ""Dog"" from memory."
,Dorsal Stream (Spatial),"""Where is the object located relative to my body?""",Hearing a car honk and instantly turning your head toward the source.
,Dorsal Stream (Action),"""How do I move my mouth to reproduce this sound?""","Hearing a new word (e.g., ""Supercalifragilistic"") and silently mouthing it to store it in working memory."
4. Clinical Audiology(Failure Modes),Decoding,"""Can I distinguish the finest details of this speech fast enough?""","Struggling to hear the difference between ""Bat"" and ""Pat"" because the brain processes the ""gap"" too slowly."
,Tolerance-Fading Memory,"""Can I hold this info in mind while ignoring the noise?""",Forgetting the beginning of a sentence because the background AC hum required too much effort to filter out.
,Integration,"""Does what I hear match what I see/know?""",Watching a person speak but failing to sync their lip movements with their voice (leading to confusion).
,Organization,"""In what order did these events occur?""","Hearing ""7-4-3"" but remembering ""4-7-3"" (Sequencing failure)."
