# Taxonomy Overview: Leaf Nodes and Example Questions

**Generated**: December 8, 2025  
**Updated**: December 21, 2025 (added P5: Atkinson-Shiffrin and P6: Baddeley cognitive models)  
**Purpose**: Map each leaf node from the Six Pillars taxonomies to concrete example questions and framework coverage

---

## How to Use This Document

This overview takes every **leaf node** (terminal concept) from the six taxonomies and provides:
1. **Example Question**: A concrete question that testing this capability would answer
2. **Framework Coverage**: Which of the 6 Pillars encompass this capability
3. **Task Layer**: Where this maps to the benchmark (Layer 1, 2, or 3)

**Framework Key:**
- **P1** = Pillar 1: Gaver (Ecological/Physics)
- **P2** = Pillar 2: Bregman (CASA/Grouping)
- **P3** = Pillar 3: Rauschecker (Neuroscience/Architecture)
- **P4** = Pillar 4: Katz (Clinical/APD)
- **P5** = Pillar 5: Atkinson-Shiffrin (Memory Stages)
- **P6** = Pillar 6: Baddeley (Working Memory Architecture)

## Design Principles for Benchmark Tasks

Based on this leaf node analysis, benchmark tasks should:

1. **Ensure Complete Coverage**: Every leaf node should be tested at least once
2. **Vary Difficulty**: Same leaf node tested across different layers (foundational → cognitive control → inferential)
3. **Test Interactions**: Include cross-cutting capabilities that require multiple leaf nodes
4. **Clinical Validity**: Include P4 stress tests that reveal failure modes
5. **Ecological Validity**: Ground questions in real-world scenarios (P1)
6. **Mechanism Validity**: Test both primitive and schema-based processes (P2)
7. **Neural Plausibility**: Respect ventral/dorsal stream separation (P3)
8. **Memory Stage Awareness**: Consider temporal persistence (P5) - test within echoic window vs. beyond it
9. **Working Memory Load**: Systematically vary load on phonological loop, visuospatial, and executive components (P6)
10. **Storage vs. Processing**: Separate tasks testing passive storage from those requiring active manipulation (P5, P6)

---

## Usage Notes

**For Task Design:**
- Use this table to select which leaf node(s) to target
- Each example question can be adapted into a specific benchmark task
- Combine multiple leaf nodes for complex tasks

**For Validation:**
- Check that your benchmark covers all 72 leaf nodes
- Ensure representation across all 6 frameworks
- Balance across the 3 task layers

**For Analysis:**
- Use framework columns to understand which theories predict performance
- Use layer column to organize tasks by difficulty
- Use cross-cutting capabilities to test integration
