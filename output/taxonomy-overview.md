# Taxonomy Overview: Leaf Nodes and Example Questions

**Generated**: December 8, 2025  
**Updated**: December 21, 2025 (Refined P4, P5, & P6 based on Baddeley 2000 Model)  
**Purpose**: Map each leaf node from the Six Pillars taxonomies to concrete example questions and framework coverage

---

## How to Use This Document

This overview takes every **leaf node** (terminal concept) from the six taxonomies and provides:
1. **Example Question**: A concrete question that testing this capability would answer
2. **Framework Coverage**: Which of the 6 Pillars encompass this capability
3. **Task Layer**: Where this maps to the benchmark (Layer 1, 2, or 3)

**Framework Key:**
- **P1** = Pillar 1: Gaver (Ecological/Physics)
- **P2** = Pillar 2: Bregman (CASA/Grouping)
- **P3** = Pillar 3: Rauschecker (Neuroscience/Architecture)
- **P4** = Pillar 4: Katz (Clinical/APD - Buffalo Model)
- **P5** = Pillar 5: Atkinson-Shiffrin (Modal Model of Memory)
- **P6** = Pillar 6: Baddeley (Working Memory - 2000 Revised Model)
