## 2. Top 3 Uncertain Classifications & Recommendations

Based on the re-evaluation against Baddeley (2012), these three tasks have the strongest case for recategorization or are the most theoretically ambiguous.

### 1. Action Reasoning (B3.T19)
*   **Current:** Sensory / Dorsal
*   **Ambiguity:** "Is the person running?" involves identifying the *sound* (Sensory) but also the *movement* (Spatial/Motor).
*   **Baddeley Link:** Baddeley (2012, p.13) explicitly mentions a **"kinesthetic or movement-based system"** linked to the Visuo-Spatial Sketchpad.
*   **Recommendation:** Change to **Visuo-Spatial Sketchpad (Kinesthetic)**. This aligns with the "Dorsal" (How/Movement) stream mapping in Pillar 3.

### 2. Turn-Taking (B3.T29)
*   **Current:** Central Executive
*   **Ambiguity:** Tracking *who* spoke requires Inhibition (CE), but tracking *where* they spoke (or simply separating stream A from B) heavily relies on Spatial location.
*   **Baddeley Link:** Baddeley (2012, p.12) discusses "Spatial STM" as preserving location. If the AI fails here (which it does, 21.2%), is it failing to *inhibit* (CE) or failing to *localize* (Sketchpad)?
*   **Recommendation:** Retain **Central Executive** as primary (because "Turn-Taking" implies temporal/social rules), but elevate **Sketchpad** to a critical secondary dependency. This confirms the "Dorsal-Blind" hypothesis.

### 3. Prosody Detection (B3.T25)
*   **Current:** Phonological Loop
*   **Ambiguity:** Prosody is acoustic (Loop), but it conveys Emotion (Buffer) and Intent (Executive).
*   **Baddeley Link:** Baddeley (p.8) notes the Loop handles "acoustic" attributes. However, distinct prosody often involves "Chunking" (p.17), which is a function of the **Episodic Buffer**.
*   **Recommendation:** Retain **Phonological Loop** because the *raw material* is the acoustic contour, but note that failure here often implies a failure to bind that contour to meaning (Buffer).

## Conclusion

The Baddeley model holds up well, but the distinction between **Sensory** (passive detection) and **Sketchpad** (active spatial/motor modeling) is the most likely source of confusion in AI benchmarking. The "Dorsal Stream" deficit observed in the ANOVA is likely a compound failure of the **Central Executive** (Inhibition) and the **Visuo-Spatial Sketchpad** (Localization/Movement).
