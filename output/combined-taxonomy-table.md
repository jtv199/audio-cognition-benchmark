### Key Insights
1.  **Spatial Failure (B3.T4):** Low score (36.3%) aligns with **Baddeley's Sketchpad** and **Katz's Integration** (Binaural), confirming a Dorsal Stream deficit.
2.  **Turn-Taking Collapse (B3.T29):** The lowest score (21.2%) represents a failure of **Baddeley's Executive Inhibition** (separating speakers) and **ASA Primitive Segregation**.
3.  **Explicit Overhead:** Tasks requiring "Explicit Reasoning" (ELU) or "Organization" (Katz) generally show a performance drop unless the signal is perfectly clear (Implicit Match).
