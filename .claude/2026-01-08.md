# Session Log: January 8, 2026

## Summary of Activities
Focused on refining the cognitive taxonomy methodology, validating task mappings against clinical standards, and pivoting the research approach based on feedback from Prof. Dang.

### 1. Taxonomy Refinement & Verification
*   **Updated `output/mmau_pro_baddeley_summary.md`:** Added specific "Example Questions" for all 38 MMAU-Pro tasks to ground the abstract categories in concrete data.
*   **Created `output/baddeley_component_verification.md`:**
    *   Systematically reviewed tasks B3.T4–B3.T38 against Baddeley (2012) decision rules.
    *   Identified "Impure" tasks (e.g., *Turn-Taking* requires both Executive Inhibition and Spatial Tracking).
    *   Proposed **secondary components** for each task to highlight complexity.
    *   Identified "Top 3 Uncertain Classifications" (Action Reasoning, Turn-Taking, Prosody).

### 2. Clinical Benchmarking (CAPD Mapping)
*   **Updated `output/capd_baddeley_mapping.md`:**
    *   Researched and added **specific clinical test names** (e.g., QuickSIN, GIN, SCAN-3, Dichotic Digits).
    *   Added **Human Norms** (e.g., GIN Threshold ~4.9ms, MLD >10dB, QuickSIN SNR-50 +2dB) to serve as a baseline for AI comparison.

### 3. Theoretical Research
*   **Investigated "Processing Depth" (Cutler 1995, Massaro 1982):** Clarified the distinction between "Sequential/Interactive" processing (Cutler) and "Independent Parallel" processing (Massaro/FLMP) to inform the "Bottom-Up vs. Top-Down" analysis of AI failures.

### 4. Strategic Pivot: From Taxonomy to Experiments
*   Addressed Prof. Dang's concern regarding "AI-based labeling" of tasks.
*   **Drafted Emails:**
    *   **Consultation:** To Prof. Julia Sarant and Dr. Grace Read (experts in Audiology/Cognition) to validate the application of clinical models to AI.
    *   **Methodology Proposal (Prof. Dang):** Proposed shifting from "Subjective Taxonomy" to **"Paired Task Stress Tests" (Cognitive Subtraction)**.
    *   **Designed 3 Specific Experiments:**
        1.  **Baddeley (Selective Interference):** Adapted Robbins et al. (1996) Chess experiment (Task + Random Number Generation) to test Executive limits.
        2.  **Atkinson-Shiffrin (Sensory vs. STM):** Adapted Sperling (1960) "Partial Report" to test the existence of an AI "Sensory Buffer."
        3.  **ASA (Continuity Illusion):** Adapted Miller & Licklider (1950) to test "Schema-driven restoration" of masked sounds.

## Key Decisions / Insights
*   **Taxonomy is limited:** Classifying existing datasets is inherently subjective due to "task impurity."
*   **Subtraction is superior:** "Paired Tasks" (Baseline vs. Manipulation) provide objective mathematical proof of cognitive bottlenecks without needing labels.
*   **Dorsal Blindness confirmed:** The review supports the hypothesis that current models fail specifically at "Where" (Spatial/Dorsal) and "Inhibition" (Executive), while succeeding at "What" (Ventral).

## Next Steps
*   Refine the "Paired Task" prompts for the pilot study.
*   Send emails to Sarant/Read (pending approval).
*   Await feedback from Prof. Dang on the experimental shift.
