#### MMAR Benchmark Details
**Full Name**: MMAR: A Challenging Benchmark for Deep Reasoning in Speech, Audio, Music, and Their Mix
**Source**: [arXiv:2505.13032](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13032)
**GitHub**: [https://github.com/ddlBoJack/MMAR](https://github.com/ddlBoJack/MMAR)

**Key Features**:
- 1,000 meticulously curated audio-question-answer triplets
- Focus on **deep multi-step reasoning** (not surface-level understanding)
- Real-world **mixed-modality audio** (not artificially synthesized)
- Requires **graduate-level perceptual and domain-specific knowledge**
- **Chain-of-Thought (CoT) annotations** for each question

**Performance Benchmarks**:
- Gemini 2.0 Flash (best): 65.6% accuracy
- Qwen-2.5-Omni 7B (best open-source): 56.7% accuracy
- Random guess baseline: 29.3% accuracy
- Critical finding: No open-source LALMs perform significantly better than random

### 3. Added MMAR to `output/benchmark-tasks.md`

#### Benchmark Overview (B4)

- Added B4 column to Layer Coverage Comparison
- Added B4 column to Framework Coverage Comparison
- Added B4 verification sources and references

### 4. Added MMAR Tasks to `output/task-database/tasks.yaml`
- Updated header to include MMAR as a source
- Added all 16 MMAR sub-categories as B4.T1-B4.T16

  - B1 (AIR-Bench): 19 tasks
  - B2 (AudioBench): 8 tasks
  - B3 (MMAU-Pro): 38 tasks
  - B4 (MMAR): 16 tasks

## Key Insights from MMAR

### What Makes MMAR Different

1. **Deep Reasoning Focus**: Every question requires multi-step reasoning beyond surface understanding
2. **Mixed-Modality Audio**: Real-world combinations (sound+music+speech), not artificially synthesized
3. **Graduate-Level Difficulty**: Some questions require expert perceptual and domain-specific knowledge
4. **Chain-of-Thought**: Every question annotated with explicit reasoning steps
5. **Newly Curated**: All data from internet videos, no data leakage from existing datasets

### MMAR Taxonomy Structure

The 4-layer hierarchy represents increasing abstraction:
- **Signal Layer**: Raw acoustic features (frequency, amplitude, duration, rhythm)
- **Perception Layer**: Human-like perceptual abstraction (sound types, speaker features, instrumentation)
- **Semantic Layer**: Understanding meaning/intent (linguistic content, sound semantics, cross-modal grounding)
- **Cultural Layer**: Social/cultural/contextual knowledge (world knowledge, social norms, domain expertise)

### Research Implications

- Current open-source LALMs struggle significantly (none beat random guessing significantly)
- Reasoning-enhanced models (LARMs) consistently outperform non-reasoning models
- Large gap between open-source and closed-source models
- Music tasks are particularly challenging across all models
- Highlights need for better audio reasoning capabilities in open-source community

---

## Next Steps (Potential)

- Consider mapping MMAR tasks to our existing L1/L2/L3 layer framework
- Analyze overlap/gaps between MMAR and other benchmarks
- Update combined-taxonomy-table.md to include MMAR mappings
- Review if any MMAR sub-categories should influence our task design
