## Summary of Activities
Expanded the theoretical framework of the benchmark by integrating clinical and cognitive models beyond Baddeley, specifically targeting speech-in-noise and scene analysis.

### 1. Theoretical Framework Expansion
*   **Integrated ELU Model:** Researched the **Ease of Language Understanding (ELU)** model (Rönnberg, 2013). Defined the **Mismatch Rule** (Implicit RAMBPHO vs. Explicit Working Memory) to explain AI performance drops in distorted or noisy auditory environments.
*   **Integrated Katz Buffalo Model:** Added clinical CAPD categories (Phonemic Decoding, Tolerance-Fading Memory, Integration, Organization) to provide a diagnostic lens for AI failures.
*   **Integrated Auditory Scene Analysis (ASA):** Added Bregman’s **Primitive vs. Schema-Based Segregation** rules to analyze how models handle complex auditory mixtures (e.g., Turn-Taking).

### 2. Taxonomy & Mapping
*   **Updated `output/decision_rule.md`:** Appended detailed decision rules and benchmarking implications for ASA, Katz, and ELU models.
*   **Created `output/combined-taxonomy-table.md`:** 
    *   Generated a master mapping for all 38 MMAU-Pro tasks (B3.T1–B3.T38).
    *   Each task is now mapped across four frameworks: Baddeley (WM), ASA (Scene), Katz (Clinical), and ELU (Processing Depth).
    *   Included performance scores and example questions to identify correlation between specific cognitive bottlenecks and model failures.

### 3. Key Task Deep-Dive
*   Generated a targeted mapping for high-interest tasks:
    *   **B3.T29 (Turn-Taking):** Lowest score (21.2%), identified as a failure of **Executive Inhibition** and **ASA Primitive Segregation**.
    *   **B3.T4 (Spatial Sound):** Low score (36.3%), confirming **Dorsal Stream** and **Katz Integration** deficits.
    *   **B3.T18 (Scene Reasoning):** Moderate score (51.9%), requiring **Episodic Buffer** and **Explicit Reasoning**.
    *   **B3.T25 (Prosody Detection):** High score (71.7%), relying on **Implicit Match** and **Phonological Loop**.

## Key Decisions / Insights
*   **Theoretical Convergence:** The "Executive Gap" identified in the Baddeley mapping aligns with "Explicit Mismatch" in ELU and "Organization/Integration" deficits in the Katz model. 
*   **Dorsal/Inhibition Core:** Model failures are heavily concentrated in tasks requiring spatial integration (Katz) and stream segregation (ASA), reinforcing the hypothesis of a missing "Auditory Objects" layer in LLM/Large Audio Model architectures.

## Next Steps
*   Finalize the experimental design for "Cognitive Subtraction" based on these refined rules.
*   Develop the Python harness for stimulus generation and pilot testing.
