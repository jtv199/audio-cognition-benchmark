## Executive Summary: The "Split Executive" Discovery

We conducted a rigorous statistical analysis (ANOVA) across 26 Large Audio Models (including Gemini, GPT-4o) using data from the MMAU-Pro benchmark. Our goal was to test which Cognitive Science framework (Baddeley, Neuroscience, etc.) best predicts AI performance failure.

**Key Findings:**
1.  **The "Neuro" Model is the Best Predictor (F=52.03, P<1e-4):** The single strongest predictor of AI failure is the distinction between **Ventral Stream** ("What" tasks: Speech, Music ID) and **Dorsal Stream** ("Where/How" tasks: Spatial, Multi-stream tracking). Current models are "Ventral-Heavy" (Mean: 46.7%) and "Dorsal-Blind" (Mean: 33.8%).
2.  **Baddeley's "Split Executive" (F=14.02):** While significant, the Baddeley model revealed a critical internal fracture. Models excel at **Executive-Logic** (Instruction Following: 54.3%) but collapse at **Executive-Inhibition** (Multi-Audio/Noise: 34.9%).
    *   *Validation:* Baddeley (2012) explicitly supports this fractionation, citing Miyake et al. (2000) who distinguish **Shifting** (Logic) from **Inhibition** (Attention). Our AI data empirically confirms this split is real and massive (20% gap).
3.  **Ecological Irrelevance (F=2.16, P=0.48):** The "Physics vs. Semantics" distinction (Ecological Pillar) has *zero* predictive power. AI models process "Sound" and "Speech" based on *how* they are processed (Stream), not *what* they represent (Source).

## Tasks Completed

### 1. Statistical Validation (ANOVA)
-   **Methodology:** Mapped 12 MMAU-Pro task categories to 6 cognitive taxonomies (Baddeley, Neuro, Eco, CASA, Katz, Atkinson). Run One-Way ANOVA across 26 models (312 data points).
-   **Output:** `output/mmau_pro_full_performance.csv` (Raw Data) and `output/data/mmau_pro_pillars_scores.csv` (Mapped Data).
-   **Result:** `P3_Neuro` explains the most variance (F=52), identifying the Dorsal Stream deficit as the primary bottleneck.

### 2. Theoretical Refinement
-   **Refined Baddeley Mapping:** Split "Central Executive" into **Logic** (High Performance) vs. **Inhibition** (Low Performance) to resolve the high variance in the initial ANOVA.
-   **Literature Confirmation:** Verified in `annurev-psych` (Baddeley, 2012) that "Fractionating the Executive" into Shifting vs. Inhibition is a standard theoretical move, now validated by AI performance data.

## Uncertainties & Methodology Flaws

*   **Aggregation Bias:** We rely on MMAU-Pro's aggregated category scores (e.g., "Speech" average) rather than raw task-level data. A high "Speech" score might mask a specific failure in "Speech Reasoning" if simple ASR dominates the average.
*   **Variance within Groups:** High variance within "Central Executive" suggested our initial grouping was too broad. The "Split Executive" finding mitigates this but requires validation on granular data.
*   **Human Equivalence:** We assume human cognitive categories apply to AI. The low F-score for Ecological Psychology suggests some human categories (Physics vs. Semantics) are *not* relevant for AI architectures.

## Next Steps & Roadmap

### Immediate (Validation)
-   **Saturated Model Comparison:** Compare our model's Deviance against a fully saturated model (Deviance=0) to quantify exactly how much variance remains unexplained.

### Short-Term (Communication)
-   **Blog Post (LessWrong style):** "AI Auditory Intelligence is Ventral-Heavy and Dorsal-Blind." Argument: We are building models that can *identify* everything but *track* nothing.
-   **Peer Update:** Share the ANOVA results. "Baddeley's model works (P<1e-4), but Neuroscience works better (F=52 vs F=14)."

### Mid-Term (Milestones)
-   **NeurIPS/ICML:** Target a workshop submission focusing on "Cognitive Evaluation of Multimodal Models."
-   **Benchmark Design:** Re-design our benchmark to explicitly test the **Dorsal Stream** (Spatial/Motion/Tracking) and **Executive Inhibition** (Noise/Conflict), as these are the proven weak points.
