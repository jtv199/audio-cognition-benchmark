# Work Session Summary - December 9, 2025

## Tasks Completed

### 1. Added B3 Task IDs to benchmark-tasks.md

**Objective**: Establish consistent B3.T1-T38 task ID numbering for MMAU-Pro skills

**Changes Made**:
- Added "Task ID" column to all 6 MMAU-Pro skill tables in [benchmark-tasks.md](../output/benchmark-tasks.md)
- Sequential numbering B3.T1-T38 following paper table order:
  - **B3.T1-T7**: Music Perceptual Skills (Table 7)
  - **B3.T8-T14**: Music Reasoning Skills (Table 8)
  - **B3.T15-T17**: Sound Perceptual Skills (Table 9)
  - **B3.T18-T22**: Sound Reasoning Skills (Table 10)
  - **B3.T23-T30**: Speech Perceptual Skills (Table 11)
  - **B3.T31-T38**: Speech Reasoning Skills (Table 12)
- Updated Usage Notes section with B3 task ID format example

**Rationale**: MMAU-Pro paper doesn't use sequential task IDs - it organizes by domain and skill type. We imposed consistent B#.T# format to match B1 (AIR-Bench) and B2 (AudioBench) structure.

### 2. Updated B3 References in combined-taxonomy-table.md

**Objective**: Replace generic B3 skill names with specific task IDs throughout taxonomy document

**Sections Updated** (7 major edits):

#### Original 6 Email Tasks (Main Priority)
Updated benchmark coverage column for all 6 tasks:
- **Stream Segregation** → B3.T29 (Speech Activity & Turn-Taking), B3.T4 (Spatial Sound Perception)
- **Schema Congruity** → B3.T18 (Acoustic Scene Reasoning), B3.T34 (Contextual/Causal Scenario Reasoning)
- **Selective Attention** → Clarified novel dimensions (Instruction Following, Multi-audio)
- **Divided Attention** → Clarified novel dimensions (Long-form audio, Multi-audio)
- **Paralinguistics** → B3.T28 (Paralinguistic/Emotion Recognition), B3.T25 (Prosody Detection), B3.T12 (Expression and Emotion Interpretation - music)
- **Causal Reasoning** → B3.T34 (Contextual/Causal), B3.T35 (Temporal & Ordering - speech), B3.T22 (Temporal Reasoning - sound)

#### Extended Taxonomy Tables
- **Layer 1 Tasks**: Updated B3 references for Material Identification (B3.T15), Harmonic Grouping (B3.T1), Onset Synchrony (B3.T35, B3.T22), Phoneme Recognition (B3.T26)
- **Layer 2 Tasks**: Updated for Spatial Attention (B3.T4), Stream Segregation Under Load (B3.T29)
- **Layer 3 Tasks**: Updated for Mass Inference (B3.T36), Environmental Reasoning (B3.T18), Event Sequence (B3.T35, B3.T22), Voice Emotion (B3.T12, B3.T28), Theory of Mind (B3.T12)

#### Analysis Sections
- **MMAU-Pro Coverage**: Updated strengths list with specific task IDs
- **Capabilities Well-Covered**: Updated all 6 capability descriptions
- **Differentiation Strategy**: Updated task overlap list
- **Framework Distribution Table**: Added specific task IDs to all framework rows
- **Appendix**: Updated B3 description with new ID structure

### 3. Displayed MMAU-Pro Table 10

**User Request**: Display Table 10 from MMAU-Pro paper

**Table 10: Reasoning Sound Skills** (5 skills):

| Task ID | Skill | Definition | Example |
|---------|-------|------------|---------|
| **B3.T18** | Acoustic Scene Reasoning | Infer broader environment from soundscape | "What equipment will one carry while traveling in this weather?" |
| **B3.T19** | Action-Based Reasoning | Infer physical actions from acoustic patterns | "In what direction is the vehicle moving?" |
| **B3.T20** | Procedural Reasoning | Understand multi-step processes from sound sequence | "What activity is shown in the audio?" (Water heating/Hanging clothes/Ironing) |
| **B3.T21** | Quantitative Reasoning | Count or compare sound event occurrences | "How many pages are in the book?" |
| **B3.T22** | Temporal Reasoning | Reason about timing or sequence of events | "At what time is the cooker whistle blown?" |

All skills are **Layer 3 (Inferential)** tasks requiring high-level reasoning about sound.

## Notes

- All edits successful on first attempt (no errors)
- Maintained consistency with B1.T# and B2.T# format
- 7 novel dimensions kept as dimensions rather than tasks (they represent testing modalities across the 38 core skills)
- Paper claims 49 skills total; 38 explicitly enumerated in Tables 7-12; difference likely includes sub-skills or dimension variants
