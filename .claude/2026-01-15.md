## Focus: The "Dual-Task" Breakthrough & Framework Crystallization

### 1. The Methodological Pivot
Today marked a significant shift in the project's logic. I moved away from the idea of "taxonomizing" existing datasets (which feels like subjective labeling) toward **Experimental Stress Testing**.

The key insight came from reviewing *Auditory Cognition and Human Performance* (Chapter 4 & 6). I realized that Baddeley didn't just "invent" the Working Memory model; he proved it using **Dual-Task Interference**.
*   *Human Logic:* If you can play chess while repeating "the-the-the," your logic center (Central Executive) must be separate from your speech center (Phonological Loop).
*   *AI Logic:* If an AI collapses on a reasoning task when we add a trivial verbal load (e.g., repeating a token), it lacks that separation. It has a "single-channel" bottleneck.

This provides the **scientific grounding** I was missing. It's not just "benchmarking"; it's **Cognitive Subtraction**.

### 2. Framework Comparison
I spent time comparing three potential paths to present to Prof. Dang:

*   **Path A: Experimental (Baddeley/Attention):**
    *   *Pros:* Structural proof of architecture. High scientific validity.
    *   *Cons:* Requires custom prompt engineering (not just running a dataset).
*   **Path B: Clinical (CAPD/Katz):**
    *   *Pros:* Benchmarks against human norms (e.g., "AI hears like a 6-year-old"). Good for detecting deficits like "Tolerance-Fading Memory."
    *   *Cons:* Diagnostic, not structural.
*   **Path C: Standard (Benchmarks):**
    *   *Pros:* Easy.
    *   *Cons:* Doesn't explain *why* models fail.

**Decision:** I am pushing for **Path A (Experimental)** as the primary driver, using Path B tasks (like Dichotic Listening) as the specific *tools* to run the experiments.

### 3. Administrative
*   **Reference Request:** I need to apply to the Australia AI Safety Institute. I drafted an email to Ting to ask if she can be listed as a reference (specifically asking for her **phone number** and email for verification).
*   **Travel:** I will be away for the next 3 meetings. I need to manage this asynchronously via email updates.

### Next Steps
1.  Finalize and send the email to Ting.
2.  Select the top 10 "representative tasks" from Chapter 6.
3.  Build the pilot harness (`run_pilot.py`) to implement the **Dual-Task** experiment (Reasoning vs. Articulatory Suppression).
