analysis of a political issue. Staub prefers the neutral scientist's listing of factors that
predispose the occurrence of genocide (for example 'political instability of the region at
risk'). This is a rather partial argument to pull off, and it is not helped by some
overgeneral assertions about human nature. And when the example cries out for a
broader political palette, as it does in the case of the Khmer Rouge, then the
insensitivity to a more openly political analysis becomes a real hindrance. One asks
oneself whether the editors asked their authors to keep things apolitical; certainly
Staub has, elsewhere, not shrunk from politically literate and concerned writing. (In
fact, he has recently been one of the few to go on public record in criticism &the United
States' lead up to the war in the Gulf.)
Reflecting on the book as a whole, two questions come to mind. I wanted to know
what it was that societal psychology explained: sometimes we were talking about
individuals (in groups or larger aggregates) sometimes about abstract social
phenomena (economics, medical ethics). It is an unresolved dilemma in this book--

The Auditory Scene
Historical Difference between Auditory and Visual Perception
If you were to pick up a general textbook on perception written
before 1965 and leaf through it, you would not find any great concern
with the perceptual or ecological questions about audition. By a per-
ceptual question I mean one that asks how our auditory systems
could build a picture of the world around us through their sensitivity to
sound, whereas by an ecological one I am referring to one that asks
how our environment tends to create and shape the sound around us.
(The two kinds of questions are related. Only by being aware of how
the sound is created and shaped in the world can we know how to use
it to derive the properties of the sound-producing events around us.)
Instead, you would find discussions of such basic auditory qualities

Chapter 3
Integration of Simultaneous Auditory Components
The task of segregating sounds that had arisen from different sources
was described in chapter 1 through the example of the spectrogram of
a mixture of sounds (see figure 1.4). It was apparent that there are
two kinds of grouping to be done. First, a process of sequential
grouping was needed to put some of the spectral components that
followed one another in time into the same perceptual stream, where
they could be used to calculate the sequential properties of a source
of sound in the environment (such as its melody or rhythm). This
process was the subject of chapter 2.
A second process was needed to partition the set of concurrent
components into distinct subsets, and to place them into different
streams where they could be used to calculate the spectral properties

Chapter 4
Schema-Based Segregation and Integration
In chapters 2 and 3, we have studied the two types of primitive
grouping, sequential and spectral, that help to solve the problem of
auditory scene analysis. We have treated them as if they were fully
explainable as automatic innate processes that act without conscious
control. However, this cannot be the whole story about the organiza-
tion of auditory signals. In many cases, hearing a signal in a mixture
of sounds depends on conscious effort and prior learning.
In the present chapter, I would like to consider the contribution
made by attention and knowledge in the perceptual analysis of sig-
nais. I will not be able to provide much of an account of the internai
machinery of knowledge-based analysis. Little relevant research has
been done. My main emphasis will be on trying to strip away the

Chapter 6
Auditory Organization in Speech Perception
I now want to examine the role of the primitive scene-analysis pro-
cesses in the perception of speech. As the discussion proceeds,
however, we will see that the contribution of primitive processes is
obscured by the contribution of speech schemas. I described some
general properties of schemas in chapter 4. Among them was the
property of being able to extract what is needed from mixtures. Since
both primitive grouping and schema-based grouping operate at the
same time, it will be difficult to know what is primitive and what is
not. The strategy that I will follow is that when the organizational
processes are the same in speech as in simpler signals, I will assume
that they derive from primitive processes, whereas when particular
capabilities for perceptual isolation are found in speech, I will assume

Summary and Conclusions: What We Do and Do
Not Know about Auditory Scene Analysis
Summary of Previous Chapters
This chapter presents my conclusions about what we do and do not
know about auditory scene analysis at present. The sequence of topics
exactly follows that of the previous chapters, so ifa point is not clear
here, or if fuller details are wanted, the reader should have no difficul-
ty in finding the corresponding material in the earlier discussion. In
this chapter I present no references to the experiments on which the
conclusions are based. The interested reader can look for them in the
earlier chapters. Sometimes I have not undertaken to define a techni-
cal word here. In such cases, a rough definition can be found in the
glossary at the end of the book.

Preface
In the late 1960s, when I began to do research on the perceptual
organization of sound, I naively thought that surely the questions that
I was puzzling about had been studied to death. I could vaguely recol-
lect the term tonal fusion and was sure that some hoary psychologist
had figured it out. Gradually, as my own research progressed, I dis-
covered that there had been a trickle of studies, but somehow the
impetus was weak. Audition had not attracted the attention that
vision had. Nonetheless, I started to explore a phenomenon that
I called auditory stream segregation (later dubbed streaming by Ulric
Neisser).
It was fortunate that I had never been trained in auditory perception
and had only the most primitive idea about the structure of sound. I
was free to pursue the phenomena as they unfolded without feeling

What in the World Do We Hear?
An Ecological Approach to Auditory Event Perception

ABSTRACT
Everyday listening is the experience of hearing events in the world rather than sounds per se. In this
paper, I take an ecological approach to everyday listening in order to overcome constraints on its study
implied by more traditional approaches. In particular, I am concerned with developing a new
framework for describing sound in terms of audible source attributes. An examination of the
continuum of structured energy from event to audition suggests that sound conveys information about
events at locations in an environment. Qualitative descriptions of the physics of sound-producing
events, complemented by protocol studies, suggest a tripartite division of sound-producing events into
those involving vibrating solids, gasses, or liquids. Within each of these categories, basic level events
are defined by the simple interactions that can cause these materials to sound, while more complex
