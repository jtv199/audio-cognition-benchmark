## Abstract / Key Concepts

Recent efforts have augmented large language models (LLMs) with external resources or internal control flows, leading to a new class of language agents. This paper proposes **Cognitive Architectures for Language Agents (CoALA)**, a framework to organize and design these agents. CoALA describes a language agent with modular memory components, a structured action space, and a generalized decision-making process. The framework is used to retrospectively survey existing work and identify future directions.

## Step 2: Classification & Rating

### Importance Rating

- **Rating**: 5/5 (Foundational)
- **Justification**: The paper proposes "Cognitive Architectures for Language Agents (CoALA)" as a conceptual framework for organizing and designing general-purpose language agents. This directly aligns with the project's goal of building an AI audio reasoning benchmark that moves beyond simple tasks to higher-order reasoning. Its theoretical framework for agent design, memory, action spaces, and decision-making is foundational for structuring AI audio reasoning.

### Mapping to Task Layers

- **Layer 1: Foundational (Perception & Schema)**: The paper's discussion of "grounding" actions and its modular memory components (episodic, semantic, procedural) are foundational to an agent's perception and knowledge schema.
- **Layer 2: Cognitive Control (Attention & Load)**: The "decision-making procedure," "planning," and "evaluation" steps in CoALA directly involve cognitive control mechanisms. "Working memory" as described is also highly relevant to cognitive load.
- **Layer 3: Inferential (Reasoning & Theory of Mind)**: The framework's core emphasis on "deep reasoning," "multi-step planning," and "decision-making" directly maps to the Inferential Layer, aiming to enable complex, higher-order reasoning.
