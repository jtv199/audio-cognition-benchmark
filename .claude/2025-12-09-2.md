# Session Summary: 2025-12-09

## Overview
This session focused on finalizing the Executive Summary for the combined taxonomy table and identifying an additional gap in benchmark coverage (Auditory Stroop Test).

---

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Rewrote Executive Summary in combined-taxonomy-table.md

**File**: `/mnt/c/Users/HighOrder/prog/audio-ml/output/combined-taxonomy-table.md` (lines 8-25)

**Changes Made**:
- Added **"What We Did"** section with 4 key accomplishments:
  1. Referenced 4 different taxonomies to identify what tasks constitute auditory cognition
  2. Sorted tasks into tables with benchmark coverage analysis across 4 benchmarks (AIR-Bench, AudioBench, MMAU-Pro, WavCaps)
  3. Verified benchmark tasks comprehensively (MMAU-Pro most thoroughly verified with 38 explicit skills)
  4. Identified potential gaps in existing benchmark coverage

- Added **clickable link** to Potential Gaps section: `[See Potential Gaps section](#potential-gaps-after-mmau-pro)`

- Added **emphasis on MMAU-Pro**: "MMAU-Pro emerges as the most comprehensive benchmark with 38 explicitly defined skills across music, sound, and speech domains, plus 7 novel testing dimensions (long-form audio, multi-audio reasoning, spatial audio, etc.)"

**Purpose**: Provides clear summary of work completed and guides readers to gap analysis findings.

### 2. Identified and Added Auditory Stroop Test Gap

**Research Question**: Does the combined-taxonomy-table.md cover the Auditory Stroop Test?

**Answer**: No - this is a distinct gap not covered in any benchmark.

**Auditory Stroop Test Description**:
- Participant hears words like "HIGH" or "LOW" spoken in either a high or low pitch
- Task: Identify the pitch of the voice while ignoring the meaning of the word
- Tests: Ability to inhibit automatic processing of word meaning (cross-dimensional interference)

**Why It's Different from Existing Tasks**:

| Aspect | Auditory Stroop | Selective Attention (in doc) |
|--------|-----------------|------------------------------|
| **Conflict Type** | Cross-dimensional interference (pitch vs. semantic meaning) | Cross-source interference (target vs. distractor speaker) |
| **Inhibition Target** | Suppress automatic word reading | Suppress competing audio stream |
| **Cognitive Mechanism** | Conflict resolution between acoustic and linguistic dimensions | Stream segregation and selection |

**Framework Classification**:
- **Layer**: Layer 2 (Cognitive Control)
- **Domain**: Cognitive Control / Interference Resolution
- **Frameworks**: P2 (CASA: Schema-based semantic processing), P3 (Neuro: Ventral vs. Dorsal stream conflict), P4 (Clinical: Organization - conflict resolution)

**Benchmark Coverage Check**:
- **B1 (AIR-Bench)**: ✗ No interference/conflict tasks
- **B2 (AudioBench)**: ✗ No Stroop-type tasks
- **B3 (MMAU-Pro)**: ✗ No explicit semantic-acoustic conflict tasks

**Action Taken**:
Added to Potential Gaps section in combined-taxonomy-table.md (line 296) with **4/5 importance**:

```markdown
| **4/5** | "Hear 'HIGH' in low pitch - identify pitch while ignoring word meaning" | **Auditory Stroop / Cross-Dimensional Conflict** | 2 | P2, P3, P4 | ✗ Not explicitly tested in any benchmark |
```

## Updated Potential Gaps Priority List

After adding Auditory Stroop, the Potential Gaps section now includes 6 gaps sorted by priority:

| Priority | Gap | Layer | Frameworks | Status |
|----------|-----|-------|------------|--------|
| **5/5** | Phonemic Restoration | 2, 3 | P2, P3, P4 | ✗ Not in any benchmark |
| **4/5** | **Auditory Stroop / Cross-Dimensional Conflict** ⭐ **NEW** | 2 | P2, P3, P4 | ✗ Not in any benchmark |
| **3/5** | Attention Switching | 2 | P2, P3, P4 | ⚠ B3 partial |
| **3/5** | Explicit Divided Attention | 2 | P2, P3, P4 | ⚠ B3 partial |
| **2/5** | Onset Synchrony Detection | 1 | P2 | ✗ Not in any benchmark |
| **1/5** | Extreme Stress Testing | 1, 2, 3 | P4 | ⚠ B3 unclear |

## Active Todo List

Current pending tasks (from previous session):

1. ✅ **Write comprehensive summary for combined-taxonomy-table.md** - COMPLETED
2. ⏳ **Verify sources cited in taxonomy-overview.md** - PENDING
3. ⏳ **Review audio cognition research book for new sources** - PENDING
4. ⏳ **Verify AIR-Bench tasks beyond AI summary (comprehensive verification)** - PENDING
5. ⏳ **Verify AudioBench tasks beyond AI summary (comprehensive verification)** - PENDING

**Note**: Only MMAU-Pro appendices have been comprehensively verified so far. AIR-Bench (B1) and AudioBench (B2) were only skimmed or AI-read, requiring deeper verification.

## Key Files Modified

### 1. `/mnt/c/Users/HighOrder/prog/audio-ml/output/combined-taxonomy-table.md`

**Lines 8-25**: Executive Summary rewrite
- Added "What We Did" section
- Added link to Potential Gaps
- Emphasized MMAU-Pro comprehensiveness

**Lines 293-300**: Potential Gaps table update
- Added Auditory Stroop Test (4/5 importance)
- Reordered table by priority (5/5 → 1/5)

---

## Context for Next Session

**Current State**:
- Executive Summary complete and accurate
- Potential Gaps section now includes 6 prioritized gaps
- MMAU-Pro (B3) comprehensively verified with 38 explicit task IDs (B3.T1-T38)
- AIR-Bench (B1) and AudioBench (B2) need deeper verification beyond AI summaries

**Next Priority Tasks**:
1. Verify sources in taxonomy-overview.md
2. Review audio cognition research book for additional sources
3. Comprehensive verification of B1 (AIR-Bench) tasks
4. Comprehensive verification of B2 (AudioBench) tasks

**Key Insight**:
Cross-dimensional interference (Auditory Stroop) represents a significant gap across ALL benchmarks. This type of cognitive control task tests conflict resolution between acoustic features (pitch) and semantic meaning (word content) - a fundamental aspect of auditory cognition not currently assessed.
