# Session Log: January 7, 2026

## Summary of Activities
The focus of this session was the deep investigation into the historical proofs of cognitive models (Atkinson-Shiffrin, Baddeley) and the initial transition from a static task taxonomy toward a dynamic experimental benchmark.

### 1. Literature Investigation (Historical Proofs)
*   **Source Analysis:** Conducted a comprehensive review of the `papers/benchmark/` directory, focusing on original source texts to identify the "proofs" that validated human cognitive components.
*   **Baddeley (2012):** Investigated the "Dual-Task Interference" and "Phonological Similarity Effect" as the foundational proofs for distinguishing the Central Executive from the Phonological Loop.
*   **Atkinson-Shiffrin (Malmberg 2019):** Analyzed the "Modal Model" to verify the distinction between passive storage (Sensory Register) and active control processes (Rehearsal/Coding).
*   **ELU Model (Rönnberg):** Explored the "Mismatch" vs. "Repair" logic to define how the brain (or an AI) handles degraded signals.

### 2. Initial Benchmark Mapping
*   **MMAU-Pro Analysis:** Began mapping MMAU-Pro's 38 tasks against the theoretical pillars (Sensory, Invariant, Specific, Executive).
*   **Identifying "Impure" Tasks:** Realized that many existing benchmarks conflate multiple cognitive layers (e.g., a "Reasoning" task that is actually limited by "Sensory" SNR), leading to the decision to move toward "Paired Stress Tests."

### 3. Methodology Refinement: The "Cognitive Subtraction" Concept
*   **Conceptual Development:** Defined the methodology of **Cognitive Subtraction** (Performance Delta = Stress Task - Baseline Task).
*   **Mapping Human Experiments to AI Prompts:** Started drafting the "Deep Research Prompt" to translate classic psychological protocols (e.g., MMN, CSCT) into AI-consumable instructions.

### 4. Technical Setup
*   **Context Management:** Updated the state snapshot to reflect the "Strategic Pivot" from Taxonomy to Paired Stress Tests.
*   **Directory Audit:** Verified the integrity of the `papers/extracted-chapters/` directory for upcoming detailed mapping.

## Key Decisions / Insights
*   **The "Control Process" Gap:** Identified that current Audio LLMs act primarily as "Sensory Registers" (passive storage) and lack the "Control Processes" (Rehearsal/Active Manipulation) defined by Atkinson-Shiffrin.
*   **Pivot Confirmation:** Decided that the benchmark must focus on **process** (falsifying models) rather than just **accuracy** (scores).

## Next Steps
*   Formally rename extracted chapters to match the Table of Contents.
*   Validate the 3 pilot experiments (Sperling, Baddeley, ASA) against the Baldwin (2012) text.
*   Draft the "Paired Test Matrix" for implementation.
